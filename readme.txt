Once installed and setup, you can use Gutenberg content blocks to present your products from Vinoshipper.

### Included Components ###
The plugin includes the following components:

* **Vinoshipper Cart** - Allows your customers add and buy products from your website on the Vinoshipper platform.
* **Product Catalog** - Display a list of your available products. Choose your default list or create a custom list of your products.

### Important Information ###
Use of this plugin connects to [Vinoshipper](https://vinoshipper.com) and requires a Vinoshipper Producer account in good standing. This allows the plugin to obtain product and store information to display to your users. This also allows users to add items to a shopping cart and initiate checkout. Please see our [Terms & Conditions](https://vinoshipper.freshdesk.com/support/solutions/articles/9000217866-terms-conditions) and [Privacy Policy](https://vinoshipper.freshdesk.com/support/solutions/articles/9000217864-privacy-policy) for more information.
